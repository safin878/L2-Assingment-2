1Ô∏è‚É£ What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), which is ACID compliant. It is used to store, query, update, delete, and create relationships between data.

2Ô∏è‚É£ What is the purpose of a database schema in PostgreSQL?

A schema is a logical grouping that contains tables, views, functions, etc. It helps keep data organized and allows multiple users to work in different environments, i.e. it ensures isolation.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Explain the Primary Key and Foreign Key concepts in PostgreSQL.


Primary Key: A unique identifier that uniquely identifies each record in a table. It can never be null or duplicated.

Foreign Key: This is a column that refers to the Primary Key of another table, creating a relationship between the data.

4Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between the VARCHAR and CHAR data types?

Aspect VARCHAR CHAR

Length Variable Fixed

Space usage Takes up space as needed Always takes up a fixed amount of space

Performance Generally fast and efficient Slightly slower on large data

VARCHAR is more commonly used because it saves space.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Explain the purpose of the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement.

The WHERE clause is used to filter data according to specific conditions.

üìå Example:

SQL

SELECT * FROM species

WHERE conservation_status = 'Endangered';

Here only those records whose conservation_status is "Endangered" will be displayed.
